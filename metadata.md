Metadata are defined in a `datapackage.json` file. It follows the [Tabular Data Package specs](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-package/#specification) and includes default Data Package properties and specific Camtrap DP properties (defined below). For a full example, see this [datapackage.json](https://github.com/tdwg/dwc-for-biologging/blob/master/derived/camtrap-dp/data/raw/datapackage.json).
