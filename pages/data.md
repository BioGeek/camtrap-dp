Data in Camtrap DP are organized as related resources (i.e. CSV files): `deployments`, `media`, and `media-observations` and/or `event-observations`. These [Tabular Data Resources](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-resource/) are described as `resources` in the `datapackage.json` file (see [Metadata](../metadata)). The descriptions of their fields follow the [Table Schema](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/) specifications and are presented below in human-readable form. Fields indicated with `*` are required (i.e. cannot be empty).
