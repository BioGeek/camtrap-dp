Data in Camtrap DP are organized as three related CSV files: `deployments.csv`, `multimedia.csv` and `observations.csv`. These [Tabular Data Resources](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/tabular-data-resource/) are described as `resources` in the `datapackage.json` file (see [Metadata](../metadata)). The descriptions of their fields follow the [Table Schema](https://specs.frictionlessdata.io/table-schema/) specifications and are presented below in human-readable form. Fields indicated with `*` are required (i.e. cannot be empty).
